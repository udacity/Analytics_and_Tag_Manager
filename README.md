##Sample App for Google Analytics and Tag Manager Udacity courses

This repo contains complete Android Studio projects for each of the Google Analytics and Tag Manager lessons in the Google Play Services Udacity course.

We provide the complete starting project for each lesson. The sample app is a simple app that generates a dinner suggestion. As you work through the course, you will add functionality to the app to include buttons for e-commerce steps, and also to show a daily special. More importantly, you'll add the code to send hits to Google Analytics and to use variables in a Tag Manager container.

The What's for Dinner sample app is a very skeletal app with very limited functionality. It has hooks for additional activities, suching as showing the recipe for the suggested dinner, but these additional activities are not implemented.

The purpose of the sample app is to provide a foundation you to learn how to add code to send hits to Google Analytics and to use Google Tag Manager.
